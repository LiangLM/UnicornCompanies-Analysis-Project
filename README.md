# UnicornCompanies-Analysis-Project
This project aims to analyse unicorn companies, focusing on key metrics such as valuation, funding amounts, and the years taken to reach unicorn status. Using datasets from CB Insights and Kaggle, we enhanced our analysis by integrating additional metrics like the age of the company, valuation growth rate, and the "Decacorn" status.

Methodology Conducted thorough data cleaning and transformations, which are detailed in the appendices of our report. Key transformations include:

Data Cleaning: Standardized units in the 'Total Raised' column across datasets. Data Transformation: Introduced new columns such as 'Age of Company' and 'Years to Achieve Unicorn Status'. We also categorised companies valued over $10 billion as 'Decacorns'. Data Modeling: Utilized K-Means clustering to segment the companies based on various financial metrics, applying the StandardScaler for normalisation. Technologies Used Python: For data cleaning, transformation, and clustering. Power BI: For data visualisation and generating interactive business insights.
